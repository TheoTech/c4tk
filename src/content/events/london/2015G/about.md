Are you a Christian in technology? Here in London we want to bring together creators, developers, UX/UI designers, product managers, entrepreneurs and anyone passionate about technology. It’s about catalysing serendipity. We want to see relationships, ideas and new projects flourish as a result of fostering this new community from across the UK and Europe.

Code for the Kingdom hackathon events have run across various cities in the United States and have engaged with incredible and diverse topics including human trafficking, bible translation, and personal generosity. Join with many other Christians in central London as we host the first Code for the Kingdom event in the UK.

Over the next few months we'll be posting up a series of challenges aimed at helping release the oppressed, teaching God’s Word, healing the sick, feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, and supporting the church and the body of Christ.
