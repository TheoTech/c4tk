intro: Scripture Insight
---
Scripture Insight provides a social reading experience where people can see what verses are important to the Body of Christ (based on Bing Search Volume data) as well as what verses may be overlooked. And this helps people pay attention to everything God is saying, not just the passages we like.

You can see a simple inviting visualization of the data for the Gospel of Matthew at http://alfredgui.github.io/scripture-insight/GospelOfMatthew.html
