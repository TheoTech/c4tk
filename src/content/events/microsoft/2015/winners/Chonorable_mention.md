intro: Visual Studio Scripture Integration
---
The Visual Studio Scripture Integration leverages the FaithLife API to create a TypeProvider that makes Scripture content and data easily accessible to F# developers (via Intellisense). If you’re a data scientists or developer you can easily write programs with Scripture content, whether for textual analysis, natural language processing of Scripture data, etc.  For example, you can calculate term frequencies for a passage of the Bible with one line of code.
