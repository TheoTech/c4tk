intro: DiscoverBible

DiscoverBible helps people enjoy the whole counsel of God. Users start by entering a passage they are familiar with. After they read it, they click next to see a related chapter they have not read yet. 

The system uses topic modeling with non-negative matrix factorization to automatically calculate relevance scores between chapters of the Bible. These scores, along with a vector of which chapters the user has already read are used to determine what chapter of the Bible someone will get next.

You can think of DiscoverBible as an adaptive, automatically generated Bible reading plan that helps you enjoy all of God's word, not just the parts you are already familiar with.
