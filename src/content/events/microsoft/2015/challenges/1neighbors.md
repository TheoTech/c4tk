Jesus commands us to love our neighbor as ourselves. But how many of your actual neighbors do you know? How can we expect our communities to flourish when we don’t even know the people living within a few hundred yards from us? How can you love someone if you don’t understand who they are, what they value, their strengths, and the challenges they face? It is easy to be unaware of the needs of others, when we don’t know them. But what a difference could we make in our community if we were intentional at loving our actual neighbors. How much safer, how much healthier would the environment in which children grow be if neighbors knew and loved each other?

How can geo-mapping technology be used in apps/sites to encourage, organize, and promote neighborhood activities led by Christians in the community, fostering a neighborhood movement? How can such technology make us aware of our neighbors’ needs and mobilize our neighborhood to meet those needs? How can technology help us know and love each other?

How can games teach children and young people why being a good neighbor is important, how to go from tolerance to grace, the skills for conflict resolution, the value of granting and receiving forgiveness, and how to live a life committed to making things better?
