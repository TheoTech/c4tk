title: Mentoring
intro: How can you help Christians be part of a network of mentors and mentees, transforming people's lives?

While Church leaders are often overwhelmed serving the needs of others, the spiritual gifts, talents, and leadership capacity of Christians at large often goes unnoticed. Yet, in todayâ€™s world, most every person has an educational or training specialty that could uniquely contribute to the life of others, the church, and the community.

 How can we leverage technology, films, and games to foster a culture of peer mentoring where people who need mentoring in one set of skills not only can be mentor by a peer but in return they can mentor others with the skills they have been gifted?
