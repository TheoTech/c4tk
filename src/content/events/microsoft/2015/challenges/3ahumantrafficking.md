title: Human Trafficking
intro:  How can technology and films activate every local church to take an intentional and active role in combating human trafficking?

Even if all the initiatives that fight human trafficking were to work as one, that would not be enough to provide for the rescue, transition, and on-going recovery needs of the large majority of victims of human trafficking worldwide.   Only The Church has enough geographical reach, members, and resources to augment the work of the anti human trafficking organizations and meet the victimsâ€™ needs when they need them, where they need them, and how they need them. 

Imagine the moment when victims of human trafficking are finally escaping their oppressors. Anti-human trafficking case workers might be helping them, but do not have a place for the victims to hide and sleep today, and perhaps a different place tomorrow, and a different place the day  after, as victims must be moved from safe place to safe place until they are truly out of the reach of their victimizers. The victims only have the clothes on their back, and they need clotting now.  They are traumatized and they need mental health care further than the case workers can provide. Maybe they do not speak the local language and need a translator. They need food. They have many urgent needs that cannot wait. But their needs are not limited to urgent needs. Transitional needs including health care, child care, substance abuse treatment, housing, education, and job training and placement are so many that anti-human trafficking organizations are unable to effectively provide by themselves. The ongoing recovery needs require true transformation that can only take place through Christ and The Church. 

How can technology help provide the bridge to a transformed life where every stone of that bridge is a local church connected by the work of anti-human trafficking organizations? What if technology allowed the creation of a global and local resource network that would enable every local church to have a pool of resources (food, housing, money, health care, clothes, training, etc) readily available so anti-human trafficking organizations can tap into those resources when, where, and how victims need them? Ask why churches do not have such readily available resources, and change that.

How can films activate in each of us, as well as The Church, the calling to fight human trafficking and partner with others to provide for the victim in your own community?
