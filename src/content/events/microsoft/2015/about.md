Code for the Kingdom @ Microsoft is a weekend event held at Microsoft inviting all Microsoft FTEs, interns. With the theme of “Tackling the Giants through Marketplace Miracles,” we will have three separate tracks: 1) traditional hack-a-thon 2) pray-a-thon (open to guests) and 3) kids’ hackathon for kids in 1-6th grade. 

How can technology help create miracles in the marketplace to tackle the “Giants” in our society? The “Giants” can be societal ills, injustice, all forms of obstacles to bring transformation in Microsoft and in our communities, cities and nations. 

For hack-a-thon track (July 10-11), we want to develop new technologies to combat social injustice, to build stronger community and authentic relationships within Microsoft, to facilitate spiritual justice, and to unleash the fullest capacity of each individual for living out his/her purpose. __This track is only open to Microsoft FTEs and interns__. 

For pray-a-thon track (July 10-11), there will be praise and worship, intercessory prayer for Microsoft, customers and subsidiaries, and for the cities and nations, teachings on social entrepreneurship, frontier missions, spiritual formation, testimonies and sharing of marketplace miracles, and more! This track is open to all Microsoft FTEs, interns, and guests.

For kids’ hack-a-thon (July 11 only), kids will learn how to code and they will do idea hackathon with the theme of transforming society through marketplace miracles. They will also learn about the nations and how they can pray for and help the nations. 

Code for the Kingdom at Microsoft is more than a hackathon where global issues are tackled by technology combined with prayer movement and kids’ hackathon. Join us at Microsoft!
