Code for the Kingdom @ Microsoft is a weekend event held at Microsoft inviting all Microsoft FTEs, interns, and guests. With the theme of “Tackling the Giants through Marketplace Miracles,” we will have three separate tracks: (1) traditional hack-a-thon (MS FTEs and interns only) (2) pray-a-thon (open to guests) and (3) kids’ hackathon (for kids of MS FTEs, 1-6th grade).
 
We are called as marketplace ministers bringing miracles to transform Microsoft and other workplaces, communities, cities, and nations. Also, we as a marketplace professional play a special role in frontier missions reaching the unreached with technology and business. How can technology help create miracles in the marketplace to tackle the “Giants” in our society? The “Giants” can be societal ills, injustice, all forms of obstacles to bring transformation in our communities, cities and nations. How can technology help bring the Kingdom forward in creative access countries?
 
For hack-a-thon track (July 10-11), we want to develop new technologies to build stronger community and authentic relationships within Microsoft, to combat social injustice, to facilitate spiritual formation, and to bring the Kingdom to unreached people groups. This track is only open to Microsoft FTEs and interns.
 
For pray-a-thon track (July 10-11), there will be praise and worship, intercessory prayer for Microsoft, employees, customers and subsidiaries, and for the cities and nations. Our skills are not sufficient to tackle the Giants in the world. We know the first step must be prayer. As David took down Goliath with the power of God, so we need this same guidance. This track also will include teachings on marketplace ministry, frontier missions, spiritual formation, testimonies of marketplace miracles, and more! This track is open to all Microsoft FTEs, interns, and guests.
 
For kids’ hack-a-thon (only July 11 9am-10pm), kids will learn how to code and they will do idea hackathon for the Kingdom. They will have fun and learn how technologies creates miracles in the Kingdom. They will also learn about the unreached people groups and nations and how they can pray for and help them.
