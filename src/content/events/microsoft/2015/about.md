<p style="margin-right: 20px">Code for the Kingdom @ Microsoft is a weekend event to be held at Microsoft inviting all Microsoft FTEs, interns, external guests, and volunteers. With the theme of “Tackling the Giants through Marketplace Miracles,” we will have three separate tracks: (1) traditional hack-a-thon (MS FTEs and interns only) (2) pray-a-thon (open to guests) and (3) kids’ hackathon (for kids of MS FTEs, 1-6th grade).</p>

We are marketplace professionals at Microsoft and our mission is to bring innovation, transformation, and even miracles to Microsoft, communities, cities, and to all nations. Our company’s vision is “Empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more”, which is also The Challenge for this year’s <a href="http://oneweek">//oneweek</a> Hackathon. 

However, often times we find there are the obstacles that block such innovation, transformation, and miracles from happening. Here, we refer such obstacles as the “Giants.” The “Giants” can be societal ills, injustice, inefficiency, depravity, disability, and all forms of defects or deficiency that we face individually, corporately, and even globally. How can Technology help tackle such “Giants”? 

For the hack-a-thon track (July 10-11), we will gather to develop new technologies which will kick butts of these “Giants” facilitating innovation, transformation, and miracles! This track is open to Microsoft FTEs and interns ONLY. We encourage all disciplines to participate. Also, this CAN be the pre-hacking opportunity for Microsoft’s company-wide //oneweek Hackathon (July 27-29). After participating MMFM hackathon, you can extend and continue your project for the company-wide hackathon as long as you register your project at //oneweek, getting full support from the company and increasing the chance of winning!  You are more than welcome to bring your own project ideas, or figure out what you want to work on the spot.  You can bring your own team, or team will be formed on the spot.  Through our talents and creativity, we can transform our workplace, communities, cities and nations together!

For the pray-a-thon track (July 10-11), there will be praise and worship, intercessory prayer for Microsoft, employees, customers and subsidiaries, and for the cities and nations. We cannot succeed just by our skills against  the Giants in the world. We know the first step must be prayer. As David took down Goliath, The Giant, with the power of God, so we need this same guidance. This track also will include teachings and sharing on marketplace ministry, frontier missions, spiritual formation, testimonies of marketplace miracles, and more! This track is open to all Microsoft FTEs, interns, and guests.

For kids’ hack-a-thon (only July 11 9am-10pm), kids will learn how to code and they will pursue ideas that would also tackle the Giants! This fun kids-centered event will teach how technology can  facilitate miracles in the world. They will also learn about unreached people groups and nations, how they can pray for and how to help them.
