## <i class="icon fa-flag"></i> Challenges

Here are the challenges to get you started. Please remember that more challenges may be presented between now and the first day of the event. If you would like to discuss with potential team members, or even with the champions of these challenges, please join <a href="mailto:mmfm@microsoft.com">MMFM@microsoft.com</a> and discuss.

In case you are already interested on a project, donâ€™t change course. But please keep in mind that your project must be aligned with the theme "Tackling the Giants through Marketplace Miracles" . Please come prepared to pitch your project at the event so that you can recruit teams to work on them.
