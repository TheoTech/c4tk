intro: Yada

Connecting with friends after church can be difficult, especially if you attend a large church. You search the crowded atrium, but have trouble finding anyone who wants to go grab lunch or hang out. Yada makes these connections a cinch by showing you which of your Facebook friends is available. Simply open Yada to connect with a friend and pick a place to meet. Yada will notify each party with a confirmation and location. Our goal is to facilitate connections that will help build community within the body..
