Raising money for mission trips is very challenging, especially for long term missionaries. Existing donors are often exhausted by constant donation requests. Imagine if you could raise money for missionaries the same way the Ice Bucket Challenge did for ALS. Building on top of an existing project, Clement and Fraser (2 out of 4 co-founders) continued to work on their startup, MultiplyMe - a crowdfunding platform for nonprofits such as churches and missionaries. Typical fundraising models focus on rallying existing donor audiences but MultiplyMe focuses on raising funds through existing donor audiences and their personal networks.
