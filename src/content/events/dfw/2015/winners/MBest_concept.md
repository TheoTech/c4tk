intro: MentorMe
---
Mentorship is crucial for engaging Christians cross-generationally. This App will focus on connecting a community of Christian women who are searching for someone to help them navigate through the struggles of life as well as those looking for an outlet to share wisdom and life experiences. 
The App will focus on finding connections in key metrics such as passions, life experiences and struggles. One key feature focuses on discretion during the early stages of matching. This allows women to find mentors who’ve walked through common struggles without infringing on their privacy. (i.e. miscarriages, sexual abuse, depression) Additional features will include curriculum offerings, engagement tools and process mapping.
All in all, this app is designed to unite women in the body of Christ to support and serve one another in the unique roles God has created them for.
