intro: Truefood
---
Truefood is a for-profit economic development company that utilizes technology to empower communities to meet their own needs. 

Truefood will focus on delivering healthy food options at a price point that is comparable or below fast food and convenience options. This grocery delivery service will source drivers and customers from “food desert” zip codes. Truefood will partner with suppliers such as grocery stores, wholesalers, community farms and farmers markets that will offer discounted pricing in return for access to these untapped marketplaces. Truefood encourages communities to care for each other, while providing jobs to community residents at the same time. 

Truefood will also have a driver development program through which drivers can achieve higher levels of responsibility and opportunity. The goal is to eradicate these neighborhoods “food desert” status by delivering more than just food, but also long-term, sustainable economic impact.
