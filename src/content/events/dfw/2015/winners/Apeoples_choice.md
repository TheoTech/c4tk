intro: "#ihaveaname"
---
A digital marketing campaign that uses a twitter connected app to virally disrupt posts that advertise human trafficking. Technology (in particular website, social networks, and mobile phones) has become the tools by which human traffickers recruit new victims and advertise to “johns”. They use those technologies to provide contact information.

"#ihaveaname" tells the trafficker: “You want to be contacted? You got it!!! The Crowd WILL contact you. "#ihaveaname" activates the crowd to send so much traffic to the trafficker’s point of contact, that such point of contact becomes ineffective for the trafficker to do business.
