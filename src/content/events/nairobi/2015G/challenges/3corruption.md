There are many people who have been transformed by the life changing message of the gospel and have powerful stories of how they stopped being corrupt. Their voice carries because they have lived life both ways, in and out of corruption and so they can navigate and encourage listeners to stay away from corruption. According to the Q4 statistics of the Communications Authority of Kenya for 2013/2014, mobile internet subscriptions dominate overall data subscription with 13.9 million subscriptions. This shows the great opportunity that internet radio has to be adopted by Kenyans given the rise of mobile internet coverage and the fact that the mobile phone is the most preferred medium to access internet.
