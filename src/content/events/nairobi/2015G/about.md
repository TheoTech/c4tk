Code for the Kingdom (C4TK) is a weekend hackathon and ongoing ecosystem where global issues are tackled from a Christian perspective. C4TK Nairobi edition will be held for the first time in Nairobi this year and the event will run from 2nd to 4th October 2015. This will be an opportunity for individuals to work in groups and share their skills in creating technology that will drive change in our country and further the Kingdom of God. The focus area for this year’s event will be corruption and we will explore several ways we can fight corruption using technology.
