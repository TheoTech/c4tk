Computer nerd who lives in the collision space of business and technology and tries to love people like Jesus.  Very simply, Marty is a problem solver.  A generalist by nature because his curiosity for new things runs unchecked; Marty brings horizontal breadth of experience across almost all company operations with deep specialties in services and product management.  He has worked in diverse companies including a 3 person garage shop, a start-up company that grew from 30 to 400 with an end game of profitable sale, and a large Enterprise with 1,000's of employees.   Marty lives in Des Moines WA with his wife and kids and carries a large heart for the widows and orphans.  If you have questions, conversations go smoother with craft beer, sour patch kids, and prayer in no particular amount or order.
