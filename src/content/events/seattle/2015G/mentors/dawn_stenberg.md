Dawn Stenberg has worked for Seattle’s Union Gospel Mission since January 2011.  In the nearly five years she’s been with the mission she has functioned in several different roles.  Starting out working at Hope Place, in their women’s recovery program, Dawn worked with women as they went through a yearlong program to help them find transformation through Jesus.  In 2012 Dawn began working with families, managing the Emergency Family Shelter in Belltown, a partnership with Mary’s Place.  At the Emergency Family Shelter Dawn served single moms who were in immediate need.  These moms would have otherwise been sleeping outside as there is very little shelter for families.  Inspired by her work in direct service, Dawn felt called to engage others in this important work.  In May of 2015 she moved into the Mission’s Church Development department. She now helps local congregations to serve those in need in their own communities, providing consulting and encouragement to local congregations.
