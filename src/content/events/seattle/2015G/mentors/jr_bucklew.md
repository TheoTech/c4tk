J.R. Bucklew is a visionary with ideas that are quickly becoming the standard in other parts of the world. Born a hearing child of deaf parents (CODA), his first language growing up was American Sign Language (ASL), and he still considers ASL his heart language.

He has a strong desire for the Deaf community to know and understand the Word of God. This has allowed him to travel to many parts of the world, both ministering to and being an advocate for the Deaf. 

Prior to coming to Albuquerque, NM, JR and his wife ministered to the Deaf in Ethiopia. They started a Deaf church and opened a caf√© that exclusively employed Deaf people. They also formed two sign language centers and helped train others to work with the Deaf.

JR is the President and visionary lead of Deaf Bible Society. JR also serves on the boards of several other Deaf ministries in the United States.
