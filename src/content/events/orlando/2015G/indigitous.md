All projects must be submitted on Indigitious.  

While out codeforthekingdom.org site serves as the source for information and link registration for every city, Indigitous officially serves as the global online community site that will connect all Code for the Kingdom participants and projects. Founded by Campus Crusade, Indigitous is a movement passionate about connecting people to Jesus using digital strategies.

<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Search for projects you might be interested in
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learn about projects others are working on
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Join a  project
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recruit others to join your project
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communicate with your project members
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manage your project
<br> 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Submit your project for judging

After you register for the hackathon, you will be asked to join Indigitous to start your Code for the Kingdom journey.
