## Eradicating Spiritual Poverty 

###What is Spiritual Poverty?

Imagine seeking after God, but having no access to His written or spoken Word.


* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="icon fa-book"></i> The Bible has not been translated in your language.
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="icon fa-book"></i> It is a punishable and criminal offense to own a Bible.
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="icon fa-book"></i> You live in a spiritual desert, where even the stories of the Bible are not known.
* &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i class="icon fa-book"></i> There exists a desperate need to breakthrough to a people that are apathetic or ignorant of scripture.


Your talent and time can help eliminate these causes. What area is the Lord leading you to hack for Him in 48 hours?

Over the next few months, challenges will be posted here from sponsors of Code for the Kingdom: Orlando. 
You may even have your own idea for eradicating Spiritual Poverty.
