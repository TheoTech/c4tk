###What is Code for the Kingdom?

Are you an entrepreneur, technologist or innovator? Have you ever wanted to impact your cities, circles and communities and solve problems that you see around you? Have you ever wanted to be the change? If yes, join us on May 22-24, 2015 for Orlando’s first Code for the Kingdom Hackathon, hosted by Wycliffe Associates. 

Code for the Kingdom is a weekend Hackathon series and ongoing ecosystem where the challenges confronting our communities, our society, our families, and our spiritual lives are tackled from a Christian perspective. The movement hosts weekend gatherings in different cities where developers, designers, ideators and others collaborate to advance common good and serve God’s Kingdom.

The expansion of Code for the Kingdom to Orlando builds upon the success of previous regional events, which have already gathered over 1000 technologists to create over 100 projects to do good. This first Orlando collaboration will leverage the skills and insights of our entrepreneurs, designers, and technologists to foster an entrepreneurial culture with Christian values and activate technologists to give their skills and some time as their contribution to the mission field.

Join some of the most talented Developers, designers, entrepreneurs, and creative people in the country as they collaborate with each other, investors, mentors, innovative non-profits and churches to create technology to help release the oppressed, teach God’s word, heal the sick, feed the hungry, clothe the naked and support the Church and the body of Christ. 
Join us this May 22-24 and let’s create technology that matters.
