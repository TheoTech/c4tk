OneHope's goal is to present God's word to every child on earth. We currently serve primarily as content providers, better equipping the church with content and tools to minister more effectively to children and youth. As the creative lead for the innovation team, I strive to explore new digital strategies for ministry on a global level. My background is in entrepreneurship, art & design, theology and philosophy, all of which have to play an important part in how I approach evangelism with technology.
