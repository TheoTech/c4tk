Matt likes asking the "What if?", "What about?", and "Why not?" questions which eventually led him and his family to Asia for 12 years. Matt currently works in the US as a global digital strategist with Cru. While nudging that 63-year-old ministry toward digital maturity, he helps energize Indigitous.org, a group passionate about connecting people to Jesus using digital strategies.
