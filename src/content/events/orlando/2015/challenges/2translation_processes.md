When scripture is first translated in to a new language it is considered to be a draft until it has been checked.  Both the drafting and checking processes are often done all on paper.  That can makes the process messy and complicated.  Can this process be improved if both the drafter and the checker have access to a pair of PCs (or a pair of Android tablets) but not an established network?
