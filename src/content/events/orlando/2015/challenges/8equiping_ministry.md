Did you know that 97% of mobile phone users use some type of texting messaging? What if you could create a new innovative way to use texting capabilities so that a church network or ministry leader can communicate the gospel via text?
What if a phone user could send a message to this new software and receive in return a verse of the day or devotional material?  What if text could be used to search the bible? What if you could text “Philippians 1:6” – and get in return the associated verse – “Being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.”?
