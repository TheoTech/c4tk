Did you know that 97% of mobile phone users use SMS texting, but only 92% use voice calls.  Mobile phones are primarily text messaging devices!  Create an SMS software package that can be run by a church network or church leader to communicate the gospel via text.
A phone could send an SMS to this software and receive in return a verse of the day or devotional material.  Texts could be sent in the form of a query – e.g., “Philippians 1:6” – and it would return the associated verse – “Being confident of this, that he who began a good work in you will carry it on to completion until the day of Christ Jesus.”
