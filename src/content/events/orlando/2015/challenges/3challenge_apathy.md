Imagine being asked an open-ended question. However, you must choose three relevant image cards from a larger deck of pictures to answer that question.  This results in an activity that is not only fun, but naturally stirs up great conversations.  Currently this activity exists as physical cards, but is being developed as an app.  We need your help to firstly, create the photo submission repository that allows for tagging and approval of localized photo sets. From there, you will help create photo repository API which populates the app to draw upon relevant photo sets for a guided and localized spiritual conversation.
