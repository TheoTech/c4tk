The unfoldingWord app currently supports viewing images and text together, but we could appeal to more people and to those who are illiterate if we can support audio and video as well.  The app will need to preserve an offline-first mentality, but still provide a way for users to get, view, and share the multimedia content.
[UI, Android, iOS, use of unfoldingWord API is recommended]
