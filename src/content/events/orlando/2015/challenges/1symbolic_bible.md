By using audio recordings, the Bible is able to be translated, shared, and heard. But this is a slow and time consuming process. Currently, symbols are created on paper to represent key thoughts in a specific order. This helps the translator remember the verses they hear and retain them as they speak passages from memory. What could be done to make this better and faster?
