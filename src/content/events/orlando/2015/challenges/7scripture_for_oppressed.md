Many parts of the world are not able to use versions of the Bible that we rely on every day, because they are copyrighted.  Access to the Bible is needed not only for blessing the reader but as a source text for other languages. This web viewer would use the unfoldingWord API to reference open-source (free-to-all) Scripture and provide it in a multitude of formats: to the screen, PDF, USFM, Docx, ODT, epub, etc.
[use of unfoldingWord API is recommended]
