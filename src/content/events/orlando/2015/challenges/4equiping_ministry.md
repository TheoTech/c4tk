Are the 3,100 unreached people groups outside of the reach of digital engagement? The assumption is, yes, but a quick look at Facebook shows people from these unreached people groups are active and identified in Facebook. Ministries are developing video and text assets to reach these people with the gospel but the assets are disconnected from each other. By the end of the weekend, we will choose an unreached/unengaged people group, collect available digital assets in their language and create a digital engagement campaign. By Sunday afternoon, we pray people from this group will be engaging relevant spiritual content in their language with the opportunity to continue exploring if they choose. We also hope this could become a duplicatable ministry process for other organizations to continue using.
