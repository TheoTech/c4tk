Raspberry Pi is a disruptive low-power, low-cost platform that has tremendous potential to impact all phases of scripture access. It could be used to host a collaboration server for teams translating scripture. It could host a local web server to share Bible content. The possibilities are endless. Can you make a Raspberry Pi product that’s ready to ship out at the end of the weekend?  Can you show others how to do it?
Tremendous amounts of free access scripture materials are being created, and for the first time these materials will have no copyright restrictions. What can you dream up to package scripture onto a tiny portable server that could be taken into the hardest places? How easy can you make the process, and how easily can you communicate the instructions?
