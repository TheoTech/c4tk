###Wycliffe Associates, our Orlando Host

Wycliffe Associates accelerates Bible translation around the world by empowering national translators and equipping the local church to share God’s Word in their own heart languages.

At least 1.3 billion people don't have the full Bible in their own language. 7,000 languages are in the world, but only 2888 languages have even just some Scripture translated. Only 531 languages have the complete Bible. Millions of people are waiting for God's Word in the language of their heart. Christian organizations and churches across the globe have united in Vision 2025, the commitment to initiate a translation in all languages which still need the Bible by the year 2025. We have less than 10 years to fulfill our commitment. 

God is on the move. Breakthrough techniques developed in just the past year are enabling the New Testament to be translated in as little as two weeks with pen and paper. Teams are deploying satellite internet to places that don't even have electricity in order to connect local churches with Bible scholars on other continents. Apps are being developed to equip persecuted Christians in the most difficult parts of the world.

What is accomplished here will transform lives and change the world for Christ.What can you create to accelerate Bible translation?
