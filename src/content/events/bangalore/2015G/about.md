Code for the Kingdom hosted its first-of-a-kind mission based Hackathon in San Francisco in 2013 and another eight such events in the US, UK and India since then. This year, Code for the Kingdom is running a global Hackathon weekend simultaneously in 15 cities around the world on the Oct 2-4 weekend. In India, we return to Bengaluru, the national IT capital and premier hub of software development.

However, this time around, India seems to be on the verge of an entrepreneurship boom. So we want to engage both existing and aspiring entrepreneurs with CROSSPLAN, a business plan summit that will give these rising stars a chance to pitch their ventures in front of a panel of Indian and international Christian angel investors. So if you have an innovative idea or an existing venture, REGISTER NOW for an opportunity to take your business to the next level!
