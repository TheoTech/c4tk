# HACKATHON FAQs
questions:
- question:
    What is Code for the Kingdom?
  answer:
    Code for the Kingdom is a weekend hackathon and ongoing ecosystem where global issues are tackled from a Christian perspective. Code for the Kingdom has hosted over 10 individual hackathons in the U.S., U.K., India etc. in the last couple of years. This year, Code for the Kingdom has already hosted a few hackathons in the U.S. but are gearing up for its first global Hackathon. On Oct 2-4 2015, 15 cities around the world will be hosting a Christian Hackathon over the weekend. Cities from America, Europe, Africa and Asia, will for the first time, host a simultaneous Christian hackathon and Bangalore is India’s sole presence on that map. Interestingly, Bangalore had hosted Code for the Kingdom in India last year from Oct 31 - Nov 2 for the first time and hence, is all set to host this wonderful community again. For the sake of ease of communication and to constantly remind users of the hashtag in action, from hereon, please note that Code For the Kingdom will always be abbreviated as #C4TK which is also the hashtag for the event.

- question:
    I can’t stay the entire 46 hours, can I still participate?   
  answer:
    Yes. We realize that 46 hours is a long time, and that some people might have other commitments, or might prefer to work remotely, or need to go home/hotel to rest and shower. Yet, you should be present for the initial few hours of the kickoff, and at some point you need be at the venue and do some work onsite. You will also need to be present for the final few hours for the project presentations and judging.   
- question:
    Can I sleep at the venue? 
  answer:
    Please connect with us as we have secured great rates for rooms at the Chancery Pavilion booked under the Code for the Kingdom brand.   
- question:
    Are there showers at the venue?
  answer:
    Yes. There is a gym as well as adjacent restrooms/showers
- question:
    Will I meet my team members before the event?   
  answer:
    Possibly. You can use the Code for the Kingdom Facebook Community https://www.facebook.com/c4tkIndia at anytime to meet other participants, propose ideas, and recruit or be recruited into a team. But you can also bring your own team, or come alone and become part of a team at the event.
- question:
    Can I present a technology that I have already built or worked on?
  answer:
    You can build on top of something you have, but whatever you present must be in alignment with the event theme and have something new created for at least one of the challenges or projects of the event and you must do some of that work at the venue during the event hours.
- question:
    Won’t other teams who are building on top of their existing works, have an unfair advantage over people like me who plan to start creating during the actual event hours?   
  answer:
    Not at all. There will be separate prizes, but of similar amount, for teams that present projects built on their existing works, and for teams that start fresh at the event. We want to honor all of you, regardless of whether you have been working for a while on something you are passionate about, or whether you decide on something brand new.
- question:
    Do I have to work non-stop?
  answer:
    No. The work space will be available non-stop (the entire hackathon) but it is up to you and your team to decide on your work schedule.
- question:
    Who owns the IP of what we make?   
  answer:
    This is ultimately a question for your team. But neither the local organizers nor Code for the Kingdom will claim any ownership of anything that you develop.

    Will I be able to test my presentation before the final presentation?   
  answer:
