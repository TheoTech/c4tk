Kathy finds the most joy in sharing the story of Jesus and watching people operate in their giftings. Through authentic humor and relevant teaching, she loves working with groups and especially church planters. Her life goals are to be an amazing disciple, wife to Ben, mom, friend, follower & leader. After serving for eight years as an executive pastor of ministry & and development, she is now the lead pastor to an awesome core of families who are re-planting a historic church in the Bay Area.The Cannons have been married for 12 years and became parents through the "zero to chaos" method of adoption. Five uh-mazing kids later, they're busy and often sleep-deprived, but convinced the fantastic 5 are going to make the best grown-ups the world has ever seen.
