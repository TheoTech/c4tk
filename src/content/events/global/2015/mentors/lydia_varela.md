Combining her extensive marketing experience, strong community relationships, and her passions for connecting people. Lydia is creating a community of vibrant and innovative women championing being a confident Latina today.

A Native Texan, Lydia is deeply connected to her local community but also considers herself a Citizen of the World. Through extensive global travel, work in international markets and volunteering with international groups, she has seen that other parts of the world (and our country) are more forward-thinking in terms of sustainable living and recycling. And she knows there are fantastic opportunities to do the same thing here. Lydia is thinking globally and acting locally. 

Lydia has 20 years of marketing and branding experience, including 14 years at Mary Kay Inc., where she developed plans and communication strategies for marketing beauty products to women around the world.  Most recently, she consulted with small businesses on branding and awareness. Lydia holds a Marketing Communications degree from The University of Texas at Arlington.

With a passion for empowering women, Lydia is active in many local organizations. After years of working to make change for the better, she is already an influencer in the community. A natural connector, Lydia enjoys volunteering, networking, local arts and social media. Her strong relationships and organizational ties afford her opportunities to communicate with and educate other influential women.
