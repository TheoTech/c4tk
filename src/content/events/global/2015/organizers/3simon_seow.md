Simon cares about bringing the unchanging gospel to a changing generation. God has written this burden into his story through making him a creative who get energized by ideas, innovations and strategies, and loves seeing lives impacted when the gospel is creatively and clearly communicated. He first experienced this through launching and leading the Creative Communications (music, film, arts, digital) ministry team in Cru Singapore. A worship leader and percussionist in his church, he is a co-founder of Indigitous and presently serves as a Digital Strategist with the Global Digital Strategies Vice-President team of Cru in Orlando. He's married and a shepherd of three kids.
