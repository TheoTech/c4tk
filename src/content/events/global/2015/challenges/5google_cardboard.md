Most people do not realize that an estimated 663 million people lack access to safe drinking water. Or that about every 90 seconds, a child under 5 dies as a result of diarrhea caused by contaminated water, poor sanitation, and unsafe hygiene practices. Let’s change that. 

Your challenge is to bring awareness to the global water crisis through an immersive virtual reality experience. Leveraging Google Cardboard create a mobile experience that informs the public of the challenges associated with contaminated water and connect the public with opportunities to be part of the solution.

Check back in the weeks ahead for additional resources pertaining to this challenge.
