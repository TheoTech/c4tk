TheoTech started as a group about the theology of technology and seeks to activate a movement of technology entrepreneurship for the gospel. This means we begin with God as our customer and work backwards to invent and create the things he wants to see in the world. We seek to unleash people to use the gifts God has given them to advance the gospel.
